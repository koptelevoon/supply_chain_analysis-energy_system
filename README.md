**1)	Project overview**<br />
-----------------------------
**Main business question:**<br />
*How can energy system operators minimize hydrogen storage capacity while maximizing renewable energy utilization?*<br /><br />

This project analyzes a local energy supply chain combining renewable electricity generation, hydrogen production, storage, and distribution. The objective is to determine how much hydrogen storage capacity is required under different system configurations, and to what extent hydrogen injection into the natural gas network can reduce that requirement.<br /><br />

Using a simulation model built in **Python and Excel**, I evaluate trade-offs between:<br />
- Renewable energy curtailment<br />
- Hydrogen storage capacity<br />
- Hydrogen injection thresholds<br />
- System flexibility options<br /><br />

The results provide data-driven guidance for capacity planning and investment decisions for Distribution System Operators (DSOs), energy planners, and infrastructure investors.<br /><br />
